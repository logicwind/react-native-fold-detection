The purpose of the package is to provide details regarding the Android folding capability.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @logicwind/react-native-fold-detection
```


## iOS

You'll need to disable auto-linking for this package.
To do so, create react-native.config.js in the root of your project with this content:
```js
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    "react-native-fold-detection": {
      platforms: {
        ios: null, // this will disable autolinking for this package on iOS
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## In App.js Wrap your app with FoldingFeatureProvider

```js
import * as React from "react";

import { FoldingFeatureProvider } from "@logicwind/react-native-fold-detection";
import SampleScreen from "./SampleScreen";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <FoldingFeatureProvider>
      <SampleScreen />
    </FoldingFeatureProvider>
  );
}
```

## In other screens

```js
import { useFoldingFeature } from "@logicwind/react-native-fold-detection";

const { layoutInfo, isTableTop, isBook, isFlat } = useFoldingFeature();
```
